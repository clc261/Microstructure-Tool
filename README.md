# Microstructure-Tool
Webpage dedicated to make learning about microstructures FUN!

https://clc261.github.io/Microstructure-Tool/


Intentions:
Our Intentions for the creation of this webpage is to create an interactive and usable source for reliable information on the microstructure of all material. We understand the microstructures have historically not been one of the most enjoyable courses taken amoung engineers, but we believe that their is way to make this subject fun and enjoyable. This webpage represents what we believe to be the learning tool to do just this. 


How:
This webpage represents a learning tool that will coorilate materials at different tempatures and representing them visually. The website prompts the user to choose from a list of materials. This will navigate the user to the phase diagram for the material of their choice. From here, the user will be able to choose from 3 distinct compositions that they would like to examine more closely and examine them at multiple tempatures.


History:
Febuarty 2020 -
This idea of this webpage came about while brain storming for .....



The Future - 
Going forward, we believe this website will have the ability to grow in the number of materials and compositions. More importantly, we hope this website will grow as a tool for everyone interested in materials science and that the information inspires them to learn more or furthers their understanding of information they already possess.Lastly, we hope that the website can continue to grow and be user friendly enough to inspire those who have not decided where they see themselves as a professional to examine opprotunities in Material Science.

We would like everyone to feel free to add to this site's information database, however as we would like this website to become a resource with a incredibly large database with your help. This requires a very specific naming and organizing standards and before adding to this website please read the POLICY document.
