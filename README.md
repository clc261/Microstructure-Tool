# Microstructure-Tool
Webpage dedicated to make learning about microstructures FUN!

Intentions:
Our Intentions for the creation of this webpage is to create an interactive and usable source for reliable information on the microstructure of all material. 



History:

Febuarty 2020 -


The Future - 



Changes:



 This website will be a learning tool and a fun place for people to learn and be inspired to learn more about material science. The website prompts the user to choose from a list of materials. This will navigate the user to the phase diagram for the material of their choice. From here, the user will be able to choose from 3 distinct compositions that they would like to examine more closely and examine them at multiple tempatures.

Those who will come across and use our website will most likely be students studying engineering or another science. 
         This website can help them further understand concepts taught in class or present brand new ideas to them. 
         There are very few websites about this specific topic of microstructures that also have an interactive component, so our website will be a new resource for students. 
         The website will be structured in a way that anyone can understand and enjoy using it, broadening our audience range.

Going forward, we believe this website will have the ability to grow in the number of materials and compositions.
    More importantly, we hope this website will grow as a tool for everyone interested in materials science and that the information inspires them to learn more or furthers their understanding of information they already possess.
    Lastly, we hope that the website can continue to grow and be user friendly enough to inspire those who have not decided where they see themselves as a professional to examine opprotunities in Material Science.

Uploading and Work Process:
	For the website design process, our group worked using GitHub. We forked (cloned) another website that was appealing to use as a base and also forked another website to use their calendar. From here, each of our five group members took different tasks and completed them individually. We worked directly together to come up with a vision of what the website would turn out like. In addition, collaborating directly with the client (in this case, the instructor) helped us to create a product that better meets the ideas of what is wanted. 
Working individually, we downloaded the main HTML file and made edits to it on our own machines. To upload any changes to the code, we did it directly in-browser through GitHub’s file editing system. This prevented the issue of multiple people having the file downloaded at the same time and overwriting each other’s changes. This also meant that we did not have to come up with our own method of checking files in and out. This system worked well and did not introduce any headaches to the project.

Our Suggested Pitt Courses for Technical Writer:
        Course information comes from the website of English department at the University of Pittsburgh. After a thorough study, we pick some representative courses for technical communication as our suggested courses.
	Initially, images which can reflect the characteristics of corresponding courses come from the websites. These images can visually help users understand these courses.
	Throughout design, the template provides section blocks for each course description. What we do is to edit the texts and images of these blocks. Plus, we add more blocks by copying the codes of original block units since we have too many courses. In addition, the size of the blocks is also adjusted to accommodate the large contents. 
	After we receive some feedback, we change our minds. Since users may have no interest in going through all course descriptions, it is better to reduce the area of the course description section. As a result, we add a collapsing function for all blocks so that users can determine by themselves to read the course descriptions which they are interested in. If they want, they can click on the blocks. On the contrary, they can simply skip this section. Codes of collapsing function are copied from another template, and inserting images is hard since it will significantly change the codes. Thus, we remove images and only keep texts.

Contact:
	Editing is simple in this section. We just replace all information with our own. In addition, we change the background color from dark to blue according to Pitt color theme.
